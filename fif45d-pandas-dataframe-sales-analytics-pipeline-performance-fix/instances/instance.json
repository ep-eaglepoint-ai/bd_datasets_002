The calculate_discounts function in process_sales.py takes 52 minutes to transform 100,000 records while the legacy Excel system completed in 90 seconds. Monitoring shows 31 rows/second with CPU at 12% on 16 cores, and memory growing from 180MB to 9.2GB before OOM termination. QA identified two failures: final_price values differ by $0.01-$0.02 on 15% of transactions, and output files sometimes contain more rows than input (10,000 input produced 21,847 rows). Must achieve sub-60s processing, exact penny-level match, and output rows equal input",
