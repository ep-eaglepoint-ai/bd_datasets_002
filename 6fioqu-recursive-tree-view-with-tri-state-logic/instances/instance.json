            "problem_statement": "Recursive components are a standard pattern, but the engineering complexity spikes when adding "Tri-State" selection logic (Checked, Unchecked, Indeterminate). The challenge lies in the bidirectional propagation of state: a "downward" flow where checking a parent checks all children, and an "upward" calculation where the state of children determines if the parent is Checked or Indeterminate. Mid-tier models frequently fail in two ways: they either mutate the prop directly (violating Vue's one-way data flow), or they fail to implement the "Indeterminate" logic correctly, leaving parents fully checked even when a child is deselected. Additionally, handling this efficiently without causing infinite render loops or deep copying the entire tree on every click presents a significant algorithmic trap.",
