The test suite must verify: JSONL reading, prompt formatting, dataset creation with the expected columns, the causal data collator producing correct tensors and labels, and a smoke test for main() that confirms argument parsing and output directory creation while mocking heavy Hugging Face components to keep tests fast, deterministic, and runnable on CPU-only machines.",
