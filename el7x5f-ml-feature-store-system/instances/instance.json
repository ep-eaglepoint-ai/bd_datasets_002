Implement a PostgreSQL registry for feature definition and lineage, integrate Great Expectations for validation and MLflow for experiment tracking, and provide SDK support for pandas, PyTorch, and scikit‑learn. Package as a Python library with a REST API, offering unified feature definition, versioning, and serving for production ML workflows.",
