            "problem_statement": "The provided legacy code demonstrates two classic Golang failures: concurrent map writes (panic) and unbounded concurrency (spawning a goroutine for every request, leading to OOM). The challenge is to refactor this into a production-grade system using the Worker Pool Pattern to throttle concurrency, Dependency Injection (Interfaces) to decouple storage, and Context Propagation for graceful shutdown. Models often fail by applying a simple Mutex without fixing the unbounded goroutine issue, or by mismanaging channel closures causing deadlocks.",
