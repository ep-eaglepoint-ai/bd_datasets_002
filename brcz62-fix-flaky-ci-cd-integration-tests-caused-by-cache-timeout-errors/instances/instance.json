            "problem_statement": "The CI/CD integration test suite is unreliable, with approximately 20% of builds failing due to “Cache timeout” errors. Attempts to mitigate the issue by adding arbitrary sleep() delays have significantly increased execution time (to ~15 minutes per run) without resolving the underlying non-deterministic behavior. The failures are highly environment-dependent, with tests passing on developer machines but failing on low-powered CI runners such as t2.micro. A more robust and deterministic synchronization mechanism is required to ensure reliability and performance",
