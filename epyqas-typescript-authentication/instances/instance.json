            "problem_statement": "This project requires a foundational authentication system built entirely from scratch to elucidate the underlying mechanics of credential-based authentication in a modern web framework. The system must implement all core primitives—including secure password handling, session management, and user validation—manually within a Next.js and TypeScript application, using only username/email and password without any external libraries or services. The implementation must prioritize educational clarity and minimalism, demonstrating secure, standard practices while explicitly excluding OAuth, third-party providers, and any features beyond the defined scope of manual registration, login, and session persistence.",
