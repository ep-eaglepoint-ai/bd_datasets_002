    "problem_statement": "You are given a production-style Go package that implements a highly concurrent batch-processing pipeline with dynamic worker scaling, retries with exponential backoff and jitter, caching with TTL, request coalescing, circuit breaking, rate limiting, optional post-processing, and lifecycle hooks. The implementation is non-deterministic unless properly controlled through dependency injection. Your task is to design and implement a comprehensive, deterministic test suite that validates the correctness, safety, and concurrency guarantees of this system under a wide range of operational conditions, without modifying the production code.",
