Implement meta-tests to validate the test suite’s quality, ensuring every test has meaningful assertions, handles edge cases, and would fail if the underlying implementation broke, while verifying proper Playwright structure, async usage, and browser context isolation. The meta-test suite must run independently and produce a health report on test integrity and coverage.
