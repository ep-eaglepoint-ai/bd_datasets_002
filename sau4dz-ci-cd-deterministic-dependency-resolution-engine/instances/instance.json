            "problem_statement": "The core dependency resolution engine of the CI/CD platform currently produces non-deterministic execution orders and crashes with recursion errors when encountering circular dependencies, leading to "flaky" builds and unreproducible deployments. A robust, fault-tolerant topological sorting implementation is required to replace the fragile legacy logic. The new system must enforce strict alphabetical determinism to guarantee identical build plans across all environments and proactively detect dependency cycles by raising informative errors with the exact cycle path, rather than hanging or crashing. The solution must be highly performant, capable of handling large dependency graphs (10,000+ nodes) efficiently using only the Python standard library.",
