            "problem_statement": "Build a GraphQL API gateway in TypeScript/Node.js 20+ using Apollo Server 4 and Apollo Federation v2 to unify and federate multiple microservice subgraphs, handling distributed query planning, authentication, and real‑time subscriptions with graphql‑ws. Implement DataLoader for batching, Redis for distributed caching/rate limiting, and OpenTelemetry for tracing, while providing a CLI tool for schema validation and composition testing. The gateway must support intelligent caching, per‑client rate limiting, and comprehensive request tracing in a production‑ready microservices architecture.
