            "problem_statement": "Distributed Go services that rely on database-level advisory locks often fail under real-world concurrency due to subtle race conditions, context misuse, connection mismanagement, and blocking database calls that interact poorly with Go’s synchronization primitives. While such systems may appear correct in low-load or single-threaded environments, they can silently degrade or catastrophically deadlock under high throughput, network latency, or partial failures. A robust database lock manager must therefore balance correctness, observability, and performance while operating safely across context cancellations, retry loops, and connection pooling without leaking resources or compromising system stability",
