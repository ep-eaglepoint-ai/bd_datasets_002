Implement auto‑save with debouncing, JWT authentication, and libraries like marked and highlight.js for parsing and syntax highlighting, ensuring a distraction‑free writing experience with persistent data. The application must provide a seamless editor‑preview workflow, robust note management, and reliable search while preventing data loss through automatic saving.",
