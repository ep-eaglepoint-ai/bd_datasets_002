            "problem_statement": "Implement an iterative Breadth-First Search (BFS) maze solver that finds the shortest path between two coordinates in a 2D grid maze containing walkable cells (0) and walls (1). Your solution must use a queue for exploration, track parent nodes for path reconstruction, and handle mazes up to 50,000×50,000 cells efficiently without recursion. Return both the coordinate list of the shortest path and its length, or an empty path if no solution exists.",
