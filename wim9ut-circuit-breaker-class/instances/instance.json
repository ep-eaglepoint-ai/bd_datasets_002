    "problem_statement": "Implement a thread-safe CircuitBreaker class in Python that wraps callable functions, tracks success/failure rates, and transitions between CLOSED (normal), OPEN (fail-fast), and HALF-OPEN (test) states based on configurable thresholds and timeouts. The circuit must prevent cascading failures by immediately rejecting requests when open, automatically testing recovery in half-open state, and resuming normal operation when healthy. Support both synchronous functions and a decorator interface for easy integration into distributed systems to protect against unavailable or slow dependencies.",
