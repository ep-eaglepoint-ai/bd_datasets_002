# 8N35BN - Offline-First IoT Telemetry Sync with HMAC and Store-and-Forward

**Category:** sft

## Overview
- Task ID: 8N35BN
- Title: Offline-First IoT Telemetry Sync with HMAC and Store-and-Forward
- Category: sft
- Repository: ep-eaglepoint-ai/bd_datasets_002
- Branch: 8n35bn-offline-first-iot-telemetry-sync-with-hmac-and-store-and-forward

## Requirements
- The Client must write events to disk (file/DB) before attempting to send them. Using in-memory arrays only is an automatic Fail (data loss risk).
- The Client must aggregate multiple events into a single HTTP request. Sending 10 HTTP requests per second for 10 events is a performance failure.
- he Client must generate a X-Signature header using crypto.createHmac. The Server must recalculate and compare it using crypto.timingSafeEqual.
- he Server must track processed Event IDs (in a Set or DB). Receiving the same batch twice must result in a success response but zero database inserts.
- The Client's sensor simulation (generating data) must not be blocked by the network synchronization loop (sending data).
- The total volume calculated on the server must match the total volume generated by the client, even after simulated network failures.
- The HMAC logic ideally includes the timestamp to prevent replay attacks (optional but good practice)
- The Client must handle ECONNRESET or 500 errors gracefully without crashing the process.
- If using fs, the code must handle simultaneous reads/writes (e.g., appending to the log while reading a batch) safely, often requiring a simple file lock or append-only logic

## Structure
- repository_before/: baseline code (`__init__.py`)
- repository_after/: optimized code (`__init__.py`)
- tests/: test suite (`__init__.py`)
- evaluation/: evaluation scripts (`evaluation.py`)
- instances/: sample/problem instances (JSON)

## Quick start
- Run tests locally: `python -m pytest -q tests`
- With Docker: `docker compose up --build --abort-on-container-exit`
- Add dependencies to `requirements.txt`

## Notes
- Keep commits focused and small.
- Open a PR when ready for review.
