1. No external libraries beyond axios/moment → violated (jest)

2. Thread-safe under 100 concurrent calls → mutex broken

3. Deterministic behavior across servers → JSON stringify nondeterminism

4. Benchmarks valid → benchmarks are artificial and misleading

5. High load behavior realistic → Promise.all(50k) is not realistic

6. API contract preserved → function now throws instead of returns

7.  Memory bounded per call → logs store full body/response",
