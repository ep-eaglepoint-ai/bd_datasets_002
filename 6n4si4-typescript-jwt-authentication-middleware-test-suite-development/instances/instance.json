            "problem_statement": "The authentication middleware is a critical security component used across 50+ API endpoints serving 100,000 daily active users. Recent security audits identified gaps in test coverage, particularly around timing attacks, token replay vulnerabilities, and algorithm confusion exploits. 

The existing test suite only covers basic valid/invalid token scenarios but lacks coverage for edge cases like clock skew tolerance, concurrent refresh token usage, and role-based access control boundaries. Without comprehensive tests, security regressions could go undetected during refactoring. The middleware implementation is in token.ts and middleware.ts, with type definitions in types.ts.",
