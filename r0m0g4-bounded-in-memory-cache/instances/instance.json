            "problem_statement": "In high-performance Java services, frequent access to data can create significant latency if every request requires recomputation or retrieval from slower storage. To maintain efficiency, an in-memory cache is needed that stores a bounded number of entries while ensuring that recently used data remains accessible and stale or expired entries are never returned. The cache must operate correctly under concurrent access, provide constant-time retrieval and updates, and enforce strict capacity limits with deterministic eviction behavior, without relying on background cleanup threads, external libraries, or global locks.",
