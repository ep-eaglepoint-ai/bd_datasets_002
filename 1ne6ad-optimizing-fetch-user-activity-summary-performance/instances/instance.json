  "problem_statement": "The fetch_user_activity_summary function suffers from O(N) memory growth and high CPU churn due to manual in-memory de-duplication, leading to API timeouts for accounts exceeding 50,000 events. The current implementation fetches all event data into memory, performs manual de-duplication using Python sets, and executes multiple loops for aggregation, causing linear memory growth and poor performance scaling.",
