            "problem_statement": "Noticed a performance challenge when testing the expense splitting application with large groups. The group detail page takes 15-20 seconds to load when a group has 50 members and 10,000 expenses. Database monitoring shows 200+ queries firing sequentially during the calculateGroupBalances function call in lib/balance-utils.ts. The page also fetches all expenses without pagination, causing memory spikes.

 Users report timeouts and the database CPU reaches 100% during balance queries. The system needs to maintain sub-2-second response times while keeping balance calculations accurate and settlement suggestions identical to current results.",
