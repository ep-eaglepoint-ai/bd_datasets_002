    "problem_statement": "Many users need to quickly crop and enhance image sharpness before sharing or downloading images, but existing tools are either heavy, require backend uploads, or compromise privacy. There is a need for a lightweight, privacy-friendly, browser-based image editing tool that performs cropping and sharpening entirely on the client side with fast previews and simple controls.",
