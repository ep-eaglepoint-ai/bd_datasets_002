            "problem_statement": "You are operating in a high-risk production environment where generated code will be executed immediately with root privileges. The task is to implement a cryptographic transformation in Python that is functionally correct, deterministic, and secure, while obeying unusually strict syntactic and semantic constraints. These constraints are designed to test a model’s ability to reason precisely about forbidden tokens, restricted function calls, and safe indirection, without introducing vulnerabilities or undefined behavior. Any deviation from the specification constitutes a critical failure.",
