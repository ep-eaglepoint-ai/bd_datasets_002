  "problem_statement": "Production monitoring of ConnectionPool class at pool/ConnectionPool.java shows critical  failures under load. Thread dumps reveal all 500 threads blocked on same monitor, dropping  throughput from 1000 ops/sec to 2 ops/sec with near-zero CPU utilization. Logs show  \"object already in use\" errors (12/day) and pool size occasionally exceeds maxSize=50  (observed 53). Threads waiting for objects sometimes hang past their configured timeout.  After InterruptedException, subsequent operations fail silently. The pool manages database  connections where validation involves a 50-500ms network ping. System must handle 500+  concurrent borrow/release operations without throughput collapse.",
