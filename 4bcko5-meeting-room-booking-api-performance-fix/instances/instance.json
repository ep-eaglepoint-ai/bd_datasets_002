  "problem_statement": "The meeting room booking API shows severe performance degradation under production load. During peak usage with 200 concurrent users, the /api/rooms endpoint takes 8-12 seconds to respond instead of <100ms. Monitoring logs reveal 47 database queries executed for just 3 rooms. The /api/bookings/mine endpoint response time increases linearly with user booking count, and /api/rooms/:id/bookings performs full table scans despite date filtering. Database CPU spikes to 95% while application CPU remains at 5%. The codebase requires optimization to achieve sub-200ms response times while maintaining identical API behavior and all existing business logic.",
