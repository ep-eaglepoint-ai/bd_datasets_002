            "problem_statement": " 50 person startup needs to replace their spreadsheet-based meeting room booking system that caused scheduling conflicts during busy periods. The previous system allowed double-bookings when multiple employees tried to reserve the same room simultaneously during peak hours (8:45-9:15 AM daily standups). The new system must handle approximately 30 concurrent users during peak times while guaranteeing that no room can ever have overlapping active bookings. The solution requires a Node.js/Express backend with PostgreSQL, a React frontend, and must run via single docker-compose command with automatic database seeding.",
