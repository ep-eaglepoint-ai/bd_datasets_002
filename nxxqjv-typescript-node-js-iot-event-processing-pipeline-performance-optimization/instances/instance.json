            "problem_statement": "Load testing revealed the event processing pipeline crashes after 4 hours of sustained traffic. Memory usage grows from 256MB to 2GB before OOM crash. Database write throughput caps at 500 events/second instead of target 10,000/second. Events drop silently when queue exceeds 10,000 items with no backpressure. 

CPU spikes to 100% when parsing large batch payloads. WebSocket client count keeps growing even after clients disconnect. Duplicate events appear in database during retry scenarios. Logs show "MaxListenersExceededWarning" repeatedly. The service handles event ingestion via HTTP, queues with BullMQ, stores in PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB, and broadcasts via WebSocket. Core logic is in database.ts, queue.ts, websocket.ts, and app.ts.",
