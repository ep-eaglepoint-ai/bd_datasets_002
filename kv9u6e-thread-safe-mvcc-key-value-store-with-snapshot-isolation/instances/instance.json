            "problem_statement": "Standard Python dictionaries are not thread-safe for complex transactional operations and lack historical versioning. High-frequency trading systems require a lightweight, in-memory storage engine that supports Snapshot Isolation allowing long-running read operations to see a consistent view of data without blocking incoming write operations. The challenge is to implement a proprietary engine that manages Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) manually, handling complex state management, version chains, and garbage collection (vacuuming) to prevent memory leaks, all without relying on external database systems like Redis or SQLite.
