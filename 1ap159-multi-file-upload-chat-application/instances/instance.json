            "problem_statement": "Support agents need to share multiple files with customers directly inside a chat interface while receiving real-time feedback on upload progress. The existing chat application only supports plain text messages and lacks file upload visibility. This limitation reduces usability, transparency, and user confidence during large or multiple file transfers. The system must be refactored to support concurrent multi-file uploads with accurate progress tracking and responsive UI behavior.",
