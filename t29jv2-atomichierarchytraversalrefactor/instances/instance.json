            "problem_statement": "The existing recursive hierarchy traversal implementation fails under production loads due to stack overflow errors, lack of cycle detection in legacy data, and exponential time complexity ($O(2^n)$) caused by redundant processing of shared sub-nodes in Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structures. The objective is to refactor the service into a thread-safe, iterative implementation that operates within a strict 128MB memory ceiling, utilizes a custom generational caching strategy, and provides atomic invalidation for targeted path updates without full cache purges.",
