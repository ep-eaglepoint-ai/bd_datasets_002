Memory usage spikes to 4GB+ causing crashes when multiple users upload images simultaneously. Image processing takes 30+ seconds and makes the API unresponsive. 

Database connections exhaust after 20 concurrent uploads with "too many connections" errors. Partial files are left on disk after server crashes. Core logic is in server.js, upload.js, storage.js, and database.js.",
