            "problem_statement": "Implement a distributed task queue system in Python 3.11+ using asyncio and Redis Streams as the message broker to process millions of jobs daily with guaranteed delivery, priority scheduling, and job dependencies. Support delayed/recurring execution, automatic retries, dead‑letter queues, and real‑time monitoring via Prometheus, while using Pydantic for validation and multiprocessing/asyncio for mixed workload concurrency. Package the system as an installable library with a CLI for worker management, ensuring high performance, reliability, and comprehensive job lifecycle tracking.",
