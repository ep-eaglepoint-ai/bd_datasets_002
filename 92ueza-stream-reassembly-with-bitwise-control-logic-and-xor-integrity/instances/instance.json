            "problem_statement": "In embedded networking, data is a continuous stream, not discrete packets. A major failure mode for mid-tier AI is treating the input of a socket read as a single, complete message. The problem requires a "Holding Buffer" pattern: data is appended to a buffer, and a loop repeatedly checks if enough bytes exist to parse a header, then the length, then the payload. If not, it waits for more data. This requires managing an internal cursor or slicing bytes. Additionally, the protocol involves mixed-type decoding based on a bit-flag (MSB of a byte) and a custom XOR checksum, which tests the model's ability to manipulate binary data beyond simple text parsing",
