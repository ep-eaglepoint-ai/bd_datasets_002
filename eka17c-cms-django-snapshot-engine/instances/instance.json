            "problem_statement": "The project aims to replace mutable content management with an immutable snapshot architecture. The primary engineering hurdle is designing a relational schema in Django that separates the 'Document' container from its 'Versions' and implementing a reliable mechanism to manage the active pointer. You must ensure that once a content version is saved, it is logically and physically immutable, and that the public API always serves the 'Live' version without exposing in-progress drafts.",
