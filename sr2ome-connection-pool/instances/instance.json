            "problem_statement": "Implement a thread‑safe ConnectionPool class in Python that manages a fixed cache of reusable connections, blocking acquisition when exhausted and automatically returning connections via context manager protocol. The pool must support configurable min/max sizes, acquisition timeouts, idle cleanup, and a PooledConnection wrapper to track state and usage statistics. The solution should prevent resource exhaustion under heavy load by efficiently reusing connections rather than repeatedly establishing new ones.",
