            "problem_statement": "Standard recursive regex engines suffer from exponential ReDoS vulnerabilities on pathological patterns. This benchmark targets the shift to a linear-time O(N) Automata strategy using Thompson's Construction. The core challenge is the full compilation pipeline: parsing infix patterns with strict operator precedence (where * binds tighter than concatenation), constructing a cyclic NFA graph, and implementing a non-recursive "Lockstep Simulation" to track active states. Failures typically involve reverting to backtracking logic, misinterpreting operator binding strength, or mishandling epsilon loops in the graph traversal.",
