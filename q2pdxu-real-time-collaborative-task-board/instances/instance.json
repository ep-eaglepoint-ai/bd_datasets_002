            "problem_statement": "Noticed a need for real-time collaboration when testing a team productivity tool. 
The existing task management solutions require manual page refreshes to see updates 
from other team members, causing confusion during sprint planning and daily standups. 
Teams need a Trello-like task board where multiple users can view and edit the same 
board simultaneously, with changes appearing instantly for all viewers. The system 
must handle users joining and leaving boards, support drag-and-drop task movement 
between columns, and maintain data consistency when two users move the same task 
at the same time. 

The application needs a Go backend with WebSocket support, a React 
frontend with drag-and-drop functionality, PostgreSQL for persistence, and JWT 
authentication — all deployable via Docker Compose for local development.",
