The script is functionally correct but intentionally inefficient, containing redundant computations, unnecessary memory allocations, excessive I/O operations, and suboptimal use of libraries. Your task is to optimize the code to improve runtime performance, memory efficiency, and code clarity while preserving its external behavior, input/output formats, and correctness.",
