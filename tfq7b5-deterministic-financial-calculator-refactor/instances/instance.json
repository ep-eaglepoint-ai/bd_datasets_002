            "problem_statement": "The existing scientific calculator web service in Go, originally built during a hackathon, is being repurposed for sensitive financial computations in a fintech platform. Current production monitoring shows non-deterministic behavior: identical inputs sometimes yield different outputs depending on execution context, time, session state, or concurrency. Such inconsistencies violate regulatory requirements (SOC2) and make the service unsuitable for audit-logged financial operations. 

Task:- Refactor the calculator to be fully deterministic, mathematically correct, error-safe, and audit-ready, while preserving the existing API and operational workflow.",
