  "problem_statement": "The objective is to implement a high-rigor, fullstack feature-flag management system that ensures absolute schema parity between the client and server. The system must utilize a central Zod schema to enforce strict data types across different flag varieties (e.g., Booleans, Percentages, and String-Enums) using discriminated unions. The state management layer, powered by Zustand, must support a 'Draft' versus 'Live' workflow, allowing users to stage multiple complex changes, validate them in real-time against the schema, and commit them atomically. To prevent data corruption in a multi-user context, the backend must implement version-based optimistic concurrency control using a local file-based persistence layer.",
