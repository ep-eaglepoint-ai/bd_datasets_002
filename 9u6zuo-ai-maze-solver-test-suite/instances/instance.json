  "problem_statement": "The AI Maze Solver is designed to find a valid path from a start point to a goal within a maze. The maze may include obstacles, dead ends, and multiple possible paths. A test suite is required to verify correct maze interpretation and path generation. The tests ensure the solver avoids obstacles and handles edge cases correctly.",
