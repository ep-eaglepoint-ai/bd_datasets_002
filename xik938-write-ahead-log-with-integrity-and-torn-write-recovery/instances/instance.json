            "problem_statement": "In database systems, durability relies on the WAL. Writing to a file is not atomic; a power failure can occur while writing byte 50 of a 100-byte record. The model must implement a framing format (e.g., [CRC][Type][Len][Data]) to detect this.
The Core Trap is Recovery Logic. A naive implementation reads the whole file and crashes on the last partial packet. A Senior implementation reads sequentially, validates checksums, and if the last packet is short or invalid, it calls file.Truncate(valid_offset) to clean the mess.
Mid-tier models often fail to implement the Sync() (fsync) call for durability, or they incorrectly implement the checksum (checksumming only the payload instead of the header+payload).",
