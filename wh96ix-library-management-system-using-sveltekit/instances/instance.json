            "problem_statement": "Managing library books and borrower records manually is time-consuming and error-prone, especially when tracking due dates, availability, and overdue items. There is a need for a web-based system that allows librarians to efficiently manage books and users while enabling borrowers to easily search, borrow, and return books. This project aims to develop a full-stack Library Management System using the SvelteKit framework to automate book management, borrowing processes, and due-date tracking through a secure and user-friendly application.",
