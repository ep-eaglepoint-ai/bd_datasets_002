  "problem_statement": "The objective is to architect a resilient state management and UI layer for an enterprise attendance system. The focus is on managing the complex lifecycle of asynchronous data: handling granular loading/error indicators in Vuex, implementing optimistic updates with rollback capabilities, and utilizing Vuetify components to provide clear feedback during volatile network conditions.",

  "requirements": {
    "req1_state_machine_architecture": "Implement a Vuex store where every asynchronous entity includes 'data', 'status' (idle, loading, error, success), and 'lastErrorMessage' properties",
    "req2_vuetify_feedback_loops": "Build components utilizing 'v-skeleton-loader' for initial data loads and 'v-snackbar' or 'v-alert' for surfacing asynchronous API errors",
    "req3_optimistic_updates_rollback": "Implement a 'toggleAttendance' action that immediately updates the local Vuex state but initiates a background API call. If the call fails, the store must revert to the previous valid state and notify the user",
    "req4_mock_api_layer": "Author a service that returns Promises with configurable delay and failure rates to simulate a production environment without a live backend",
    "req5_data_normalization": "The Vuex store must normalize attendance records by their unique ID to ensure that an update to one record is propagated across all components using that data without redundant API calls",
    "req6_actionable_retries": "Components must provide a 'Retry' mechanism for failed requests, which re-triggers the specific Vuex action responsible for the failed state",
    "req7_state_transition_testing": "Verify that the 'status' property in the store correctly transitions from 'loading' to either 'success' or 'error' and never gets stuck in a pending state",
    "req8_ui_resilience_testing": "Demonstrate that the UI remains interactive and provides visual feedback (e.g., 'v-progress-circular') while multiple concurrent background updates are in flight",
    "req9_data_integrity_testing": "Verify that after a simulated 500 error during an optimistic update, the final state of the store matches the 'server' state exactly, with no 'ghost' updates remaining in the UI"
