            "problem_statement": "The e-commerce platform's shopping cart service handles cart operations, inventory checks, and checkout processing but has no integration test coverage. Recent production issues included race conditions when multiple users added the same limited-stock item, incorrect price calculations during concurrent cart updates, and orphaned cart records after failed checkouts. 

The service uses Entity Framework Core with SQL Server. Need comprehensive integration tests that verify database interactions, API contracts, and concurrent access scenarios.",
