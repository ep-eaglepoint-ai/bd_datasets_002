            "problem_statement": "Modern e-commerce systems must process customer orders in a way that is reliable, consistent, and resistant to common failures such as invalid input, duplicate requests, and inventory conflicts. Generating a robust PostgreSQL function for order processing is necessary to ensure that business rules are enforced at the database level, transactions remain atomic, and errors are handled predictably in real-world scenarios where multiple operations must succeed or fail together. This function serves as a critical safeguard for data integrity, auditability, and system stability under production conditions.",
