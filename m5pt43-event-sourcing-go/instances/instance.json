Integrate NATS JetStream for reliable cross‑service event distribution via the outbox pattern, support schema evolution with Protocol Buffers, and enforce eventual consistency for event‑driven applications. Package as a Go module with full documentation and examples, enabling complete audit trails, temporal queries, and robust event‑driven architecture.",
