            "problem_statement": "Implement a production‑grade Java thread pool executor that supports configurable core/max pool sizes, bounded work queues, four rejection policies, priority‑based scheduling, and graceful shutdown while implementing the `ExecutorService` interface for standard compatibility. The pool must lazily create core threads, terminate idle threads beyond the core size after a keep‑alive timeout, and handle both `Runnable` and `Callable` tasks with proper `Future` cancellation and timeout support. Use `ReentrantLock` with minimal contention, ensure zero resource leaks during shutdown, and pass stress tests of 100 threads submitting 10,000 tasks each without deadlocks or lost work.",
