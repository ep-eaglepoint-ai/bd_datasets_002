            "problem_statement": "Noticed severe performance degradation when testing an in-memory document search 
index for a legal document management system. The DocumentIndex class in a Java 17 
application takes 45 seconds to index 100,000 legal documents (averaging 5KB each) 
and search queries take 800ms on average. 

Users report the application becomes  unresponsive during indexing, with visible freezes during searches. Memory profiling  shows usage spiking to 8GB for what should be a 500MB document corpus, with GC  pauses occurring every few seconds. The system worked acceptably during development  with 10,000 documents but becomes unusable at production scale.",
