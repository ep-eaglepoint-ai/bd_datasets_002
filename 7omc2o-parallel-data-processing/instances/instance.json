            "problem_statement": "Refactor a parallel Python data‑processing system that currently spawns processes per item and uses file‑based IPC to instead use multiprocessing.Pool with batched work (≥1000 items per batch) and efficient shared‑memory communication, eliminating all O(n²) operations and excessive queue overhead. Implement optimized algorithms like the Sieve of Eratosthenes for primes and numpy‑based blocked matrix multiplication, ensuring at least 10x speedup for 100,000+ items and linear scaling across CPU cores. All sorting and string operations must use Python’s built‑in efficient implementations while maintaining correctness for data transformation, map‑reduce, and pipeline tasks.
