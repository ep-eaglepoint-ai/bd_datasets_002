            "problem_statement": "Debug an asynchronous Python task queue with worker pools, priority ordering, retries, and caching that suffers from data corruption, race conditions, memory leaks, and deadlocks under concurrent load. Identify and fix critical bugs including improper async/await usage, missing locks on shared state, incorrect retry logic, resource leaks, and deadlock-prone synchronization to correctly handle 10,000 concurrent tasks without errors. The corrected implementation must maintain proper priority ordering, handle task cancellation safely, prevent race conditions, manage asyncio resources without leaks, and pass all existing tests while preserving the original design’s core functionality.",
