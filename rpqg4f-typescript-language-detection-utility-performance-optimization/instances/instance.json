            "problem_statement": "Noticed severe performance degradation when load testing a content moderation system's language detection utility. The checkLanguage function in languageDetection.ts takes over 1300ms to process a batch of 10,000 messages, exceeding the 1-second target required for real-time message routing. Profiling shows excessive regex compilation happening on every function call, redundant calls to the franc language detection library, and O(n²) string operations in a custom toLowerCase implementation. 

The utility processes user messages to determine if they need translation before routing to English-speaking support agents, and the current performance is causing message queue backlogs during high-traffic periods when the system processes 50,000+ messages per hour. The system needs to maintain identical detection behavior while significantly improving throughput to meet the sub-second batch processing requirement.",
