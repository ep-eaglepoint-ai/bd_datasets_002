            "problem_statement": "Build a production-ready API rate limiter library from scratch supporting multiple algorithms. The system must handle per-user and per-endpoint throttling with configurable time windows. It needs to support fixed window counter, sliding window log, sliding window counter (hybrid), and token bucket algorithms. 

The implementation must be thread-safe for concurrent request handling and include an in-memory storage backend with automatic TTL-based cleanup. No external dependencies allowed - use Python standard library only. Starter scaffold is in limiter.py, storage.py, algorithms.py, and types.py.
