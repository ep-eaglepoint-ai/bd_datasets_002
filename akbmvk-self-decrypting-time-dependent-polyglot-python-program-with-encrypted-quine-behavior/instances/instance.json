            "problem_statement": "Design a fully self‑contained Python program that embeds a single encrypted payload and dynamically decrypts and executes different logic based on the system clock minute. The program must demonstrate reasoning over time‑based conditions, self‑reference, encryption/decryption, and dynamic code execution, while remaining deterministic, sandbox‑safe, and compliant with strict implementation constraints. The system must also act as a quine with respect to its encrypted form by printing its own encrypted payload before execution.",
