            "problem_statement": "Modern applications need a safe and flexible way to release features without redeploying code. Enabling a feature for all users at once increases the risk of bugs, outages, and poor user experience. Teams also need the ability to test features with specific users, gradually roll out changes, and instantly disable problematic functionality. This project addresses these challenges by providing a centralized Feature Flag Management System that allows controlled feature releases, user-specific overrides, and percentage-based rollouts through a secure, backend-driven architecture with a minimal administrative interface.",
