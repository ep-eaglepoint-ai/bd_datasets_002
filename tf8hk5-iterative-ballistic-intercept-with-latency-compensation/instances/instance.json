            "problem_statement": "The core difficulty is the "Intercept Problem" in a real-time context. In standard web apps, time is static. In ballistics, time is a variable that affects the destination. Mid-tier models fail to recognize the circular dependency between "Time to Target" and "Target Position at Time T," often defaulting to a static snapshot calculation that results in a "tail-chase" miss. Furthermore, the integration of network latency compensation (synchronizing Date.now() with packet.timestamp) separates senior-level systems engineering from junior scripting. The logic requires extrapolating past data into the future while solving a converging series, a pattern that mid-tier models often mistake for a simple distance-over-time division.
