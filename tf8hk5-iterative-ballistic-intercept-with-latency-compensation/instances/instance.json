  "problem_statement": "The core difficulty is the Intercept Problem in a real-time context. Unlike standard web applications where time is static, ballistic interception requires solving a circular dependency between time-to-target and target position at time T. Naive implementations default to static snapshot calculations, resulting in tail-chase misses. Correct solutions must iteratively converge on an intercept while compensating for network latency by synchronizing packet timestamps with Date.now(), extrapolating past state into the future, and handling impossible intercept scenarios.",
