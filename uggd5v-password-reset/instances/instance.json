            "problem_statement": "In modern applications, securely handling user password resets is critical to both user experience and system security. Writing a PostgreSQL function to initiate password resets ensures that the process is handled atomically and consistently at the database level, preventing race conditions, duplicate requests, and unauthorized token generation. Such a function allows validation of user status, enforces idempotency through unique request identifiers, manages token expiration, and logs all actions for auditability. By centralizing this logic in the database using PL/pgSQL, the system guarantees transactional integrity, robust error handling with standardized error codes, and safe handling of untrusted input—essential safeguards for maintaining security and reliability in a production environment.",
