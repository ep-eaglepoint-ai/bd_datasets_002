            "problem_statement": "Implement a production‑grade Python in‑memory job queue system with heap‑based priority scheduling (O(log n) enqueue/dequeue), delayed execution, automatic retries with exponential backoff, and dead‑letter handling for failed jobs. The library must support multiple named queues with independent configurations, thread‑safe concurrent access, job dependencies, and at‑least‑once semantics while scaling to 10,000+ concurrent jobs. The system must include a JobQueueManager for coordination, a Worker class for job execution, and comprehensive job lifecycle tracking—all with deterministic ordering by priority, scheduled time, and submission sequence.
