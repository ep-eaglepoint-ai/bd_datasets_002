            "problem_statement": "Build an offline-first goal tracking web application using Next.js and TailwindCSS that lets users define goals, break them into milestones, log progress, and analyze performance trends through interactive dashboards—all running client-side with IndexedDB persistence and Zod validation. Implement state management with Zustand/Redux and performance optimizations like virtualization and memoized computations to ensure responsiveness with long-term data. The system must robustly handle incomplete plans, shifting priorities, and historical edits while providing explainable analytics and reliable offline operation.",
