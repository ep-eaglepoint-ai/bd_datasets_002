            "problem_statement": "The background job system crashes during peak load due to unbounded goroutine creation. Current implementation spawns a new goroutine per task, causing 50,000+ goroutines and OOM crashes. Payment webhooks process after marketing emails because there's no priority ordering. 

Failed tasks are lost permanently with no retry mechanism. Deployments kill in-flight tasks immediately, corrupting partial operations. The system needs bounded concurrency with a fixed worker pool, priority-based processing, automatic retries with backoff, and graceful shutdown. Core interfaces are defined in task.go and scheduler.go.",
