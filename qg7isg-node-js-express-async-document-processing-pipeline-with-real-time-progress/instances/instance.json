            "problem_statement": "The integration team receives data files from partners in CSV, JSON, and XML formats that require validation, transformation, and database loading. Current synchronous implementation crashes on files over 100MB due to full memory loading. Partners report no visibility into processing status and frequently ask support for updates. Processing a 50MB file takes 3 minutes with no progress indication. The team needs a streaming file processor with real-time WebSocket updates, partner-specific schema validation, configurable transformation rules, and individual error logging without stopping the pipeline. Target is handling 500MB files with progress broadcasts every 2 seconds",
