            "problem_statement": "The objective is to implement a 3D airspace deconfliction algorithm in Go. This involves linear trajectory projection, proximity detection within a defined spherical threshold, and a priority-based resolution strategy. The primary engineering challenge is ensuring the 20ms performance constraint while handling cascading dependencies where one altitude adjustment affects other neighboring drones.",
