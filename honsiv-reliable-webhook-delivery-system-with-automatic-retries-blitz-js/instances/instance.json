Without retries, visibility, and idempotency, failed webhook deliveries can cause data inconsistency, missed events, and poor developer experience. We need a reliable, observable, and retryable webhook delivery system that guarantees best-effort delivery, provides auditability, and allows manual intervention when failures occur",
