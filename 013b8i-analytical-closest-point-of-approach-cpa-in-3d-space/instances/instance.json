            "problem_statement": "Collision detection in gaming and simulation is often done by "stepping" through time (checking positions at t=1, t=2, t=3). In safety-critical avionics, this is unacceptable because a collision could occur at t=1.5, which the step check would miss. The challenge is to implement the CPA (Closest Point of Approach) algorithm, which uses calculus/geometry to find the exact time t when two 3D vectors are closest. This requires solving a quadratic equation (or minimizing the distance squared function) to find t without looping.
