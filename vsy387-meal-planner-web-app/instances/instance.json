Implement Zod for validation and IndexedDB for persistent local storage, ensuring robust handling of missing ingredients, duplicate items, empty plan days, and long‑term data growth. The application must provide a clean interface for managing meals, editing ingredients, exporting plans, and maintaining reliable weekly planning functionality entirely offline.
