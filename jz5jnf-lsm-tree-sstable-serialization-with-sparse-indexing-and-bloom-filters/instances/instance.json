            "problem_statement": "The architecture of a Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM) relies on immutable on-disk structures (SSTables) that must be queryable without loading the entire file into memory. This requires a specific binary layout involving length-prefixed records, a Sparse Index for seeking, and a Bloom Filter for membership testing. The primary failure mode for mid-tier models is the mismanagement of file offsets; they often write data without tracking the exact byte cursor, resulting in an index that points to the middle of a record rather than its header. Additionally, the construction of the file Footer which must contain pointers to the variable-length Index and Filter sections creates a sequencing paradox that requires careful byte counting. Finally, implementing a Bloom Filter from scratch tests the model's grasp of bitwise operations versus standard collection types; utilizing a simple map or boolean array negates the space-efficiency purpose of the structure.",
