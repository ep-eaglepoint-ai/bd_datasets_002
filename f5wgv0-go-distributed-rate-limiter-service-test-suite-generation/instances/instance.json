            "problem_statement": "Noticed insufficient test coverage when reviewing a distributed rate limiter service before production deployment. The service in the ratelimiter package uses Redis for shared state and gRPC for the interface. Current tests only cover single-instance happy paths. During load testing, rate limits appeared bypassed when traffic shifted between instances, and failover behavior was inconsistent during Redis downtime. The implementation in limiter.go and grpc_server.go needs comprehensive tests covering distributed scenarios, failure modes, and race conditions before the ten-instance production deployment can proceed",
