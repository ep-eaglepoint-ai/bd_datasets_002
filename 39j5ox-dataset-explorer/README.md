## Commands

- `docker-compose up app` – Start the development server
- `docker-compose up test` – Run tests once (currently tests **only `repository_before`**, since this project is starting from scratch as a full-stack implementation)
- `docker-compose up evaluate` – Run evaluation and generate reports
