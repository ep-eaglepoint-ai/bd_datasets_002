            "problem_statement": "The live chat moderation service suffers severe performance degradation because its content filtering function uses inefficient rule-matching logic that scales poorly with the number of safety rules. Under peak traffic, this causes 100% CPU usage, event backlogs, and latency spikes. The task is to redesign the content processing logic to achieve near-linear performance per event, support tens of thousands of rules without slowdown, eliminate unnecessary memory allocations in hot paths, and preserve exact rule-matching behavior within a standard Node.js environment.",
