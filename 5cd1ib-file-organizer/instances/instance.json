            "problem_statement": "Build a fully local File Organizer Dashboard that recursively indexes and analyzes files on a user's computer without external APIs, collecting detailed metadata and detecting duplicates via content hashing while handling permission-restricted files, symbolic links, and dynamic directory changes robustly. The system must implement incremental indexing for efficiency, store all data in a persistent local database to ensure resilience against shutdowns or partial writes, and provide a responsive UI for searching, filtering, and managing files with bulk operations. The application must prioritize deterministic behavior, consistent duplicate detection, graceful error handling, and long-term performance stability even when indexing hundreds of thousands of files.
