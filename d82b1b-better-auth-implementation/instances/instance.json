    "problem_statement": "This project requires the design of a minimal, foundational authentication system to demonstrate core credential-based authentication fundamentals. The system must be built using TypeScript and Next.js, implementing secure user registration and login exclusively with username/email and password via the better-auth library and MongoDB. The scope is strictly limited to these core features, explicitly excluding OAuth, magic links, external providers, and any non-essential abstractions to ensure clarity and correctness as a learning reference or application foundation.",
